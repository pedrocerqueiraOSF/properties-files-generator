This script can be optimized. In the future I will optimize it and fix possible bugs.

In order to generate properties files from an xlsx file:
1 - Open the project in VS Code
2 - run in the terminal: "npm i" . This command installs the project's dependencies.
3 - Open the index.js file
4 - Change the value of the variable "excelFilePath" to the value with the path of the Excel file you want to export
5 - In the terminal run "node index.js"
6 - The files should be generated in the properties folder
